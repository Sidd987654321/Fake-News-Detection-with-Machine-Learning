# 📰 Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

🚀 **Can machines spot the truth?**
In today’s digital era, misinformation spreads faster than ever. This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to classify news articles as **Fake** or **True** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses two datasets:

* ✅ `True.csv` → Genuine news articles
* ❌ `Fake.csv` → Fake/false news articles

Both datasets are combined, labeled, and processed to create a robust training pipeline.

## 🔎 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration

* Loaded and merged **True** and **Fake** datasets.
* Added target labels (`1 = True`, `0 = Fake`).
* Checked for duplicates and balanced distribution.

### 2️⃣ Text Preprocessing

* Cleaning text (removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters).
* Lemmatization & tokenization.
* Converting text into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.

### 3️⃣ Model Training

Tested multiple Machine Learning models, including:

* 🤖 Logistic Regression
* 📊 Naive Bayes
* 🌲 Random Forest
* 📈 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 4️⃣ Evaluation

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix for detailed performance

## 📊 Results

✨ Our models achieved outstanding performance in detecting fake vs. true news:

* **Model 1**:

  * Accuracy: **99%**
  * Precision: 0.99 | Recall: 0.99 | F1-score: 0.99

* **Model 2 (Best Model)**:

  * Accuracy: **100%**
  * Precision: 1.00 | Recall: 1.00 | F1-score: 1.00

📌 The best-performing model was able to classify news articles with **perfect accuracy** on the test dataset, highlighting the strength of machine learning in detecting misinformation.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection

2. Install required dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook "fakenews (1).ipynb"

## 🔓 Extracting the Dataset

### Option 1: Windows

* Install [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
* Right-click on each `.csv.gz` file → **Extract Here**.
* You will get:

  * `Fake.csv`
  * `True.csv`

### Option 2: Linux / macOS / WSL

Run the following commands in terminal:

gunzip Fake.csv.gz
gunzip True.csv.gz

After extraction, keep both `.csv` files in the project folder.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* ✅ Use Deep Learning models (LSTM, GRU, BERT).
* ✅ Deploy as a Web App with Flask/Django.
* ✅ Add real-time fake news detection using APIs.

## 🛠️ Built With
